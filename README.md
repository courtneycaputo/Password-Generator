## About the Project
This project was to create a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I learned how to create a JavaScript file with multiple functions and variables to generate a random password. The one issue I am having is that the last character repeats itself. I feel this web page would be more effective at generating a secure password if characters were not repeated. As additional study, I will look into ways in which I can write JavaScript code to ensure that none of the characters do not repeat themselves.
